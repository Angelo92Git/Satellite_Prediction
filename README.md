# Modeling satellite orbits using a simple time series autoregressive approach
This project was performed as part of the course requirement for STAT844: Advanced Regression, at the University of Waterloo
Please refer to STAT844_Project.pdf for the full report.

The goal of this project was to evaluate a simple auto-regressive approach to modeling a satellite orbit without any prior physics knowledge. 
Despite scoring well on the dataset sourced from the International Data Analysis Olympiad (IDAO) competition, the simple autoregressive model does not guarantee physically consistent results. 
The report identifies contexts where data-driven models such as the one used here may be useful.
